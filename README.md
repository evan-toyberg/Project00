# Project00

 Modify this software so that your team will be added to the course with each team member's
      name being output after the team name is output.
      This will require each team to chose a member to create a fork of the repositry repository.
      This team member will need to invite the other team members to have public access to the repository.
      The team member will need the email address of the other team members to set this up. 
      This is done by going to Setting -> Manage Access and inviting the other team members to be collaborators.
      Each team member will then clone the repository. The original version of the software should be on your 
      local machine now in a git directory. 
      Study the code and understand how it works.
      Each team member will, one at a time, modify the code to add their name to the team. The team member who
      forked the code will need to write the code to add the team to the course. This development must be done
      sequentially. That is one member of the team will make a pull request to get the current version of the software.
      They will then add their code to the software, add the modified files, commit the files and then push the modified
      code back to the repository. Then the next team member goes through the same process.
      After all modifications have been made and your team has tested the software to ensure the team name and team members
      are listed on the output just like the example code does, the the team member who forked the reposiroty will issue a pull
      request that will allow me to merge each team's code back into the central code repository on my GitHub account. After
      merging in the changes to the software I should be able to run the program and see all the team names and team members 
      printed out.
